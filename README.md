# About

**Whats the goal**

My goal is to create an operating system that is feuled by the internet.

**Heres how I plan to do it**

* Create a system application out of any website.
  * If you can do it in a web browser you can do it with Project Opaque.

* Full IDE called Gitpod.
  * Great for web development.

* For portability the entrety of your Project Opaque filesystem will be stored in one folder on your hard drive.
  * you will also be able to use files from cloud storage services.
  * And you may even be able to use an external source such as a usb to keep all of your files on.

**Inspiration behind it**
